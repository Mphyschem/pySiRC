        This application consists of the automatic prediction of reaction rate constant of the radical-based oxidation process
        of aqueous organic contaminants based on Machine Learning models using molecular fingerprints (FP2).
        It is only necessary to inform the SMILES or CAS Number format of a specific molecule.
        The models present in this work were built using [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) package.
        The predict values can be confronted with experimental values available in ref. [our] or [kinetics.nist.gov/solution](kinetics.nist.gov/solution). 

        ## About
        pySiRC was designed to facilitate the automatic researchers to prediction and analyze of reaction rate constants
        using Machine Learning models, since the theoretical calculation and experimental measures of these kinetic
        parameters can be extremely challenging. The tools are designed to be quick and simple users with few clicks
        can make the prediction. The tools are rigorous enough to have applications in academic research.
